# HIGH PRIORITY
================
* Pass 'R CMD check' implement a few things that can't easily be done already with other packages
* summary method: if tip and node don't have identical colnames, don't try to get alldata and/or: more stringent tests e.g. column names match in tip and node (if all.data)? [FIXED: tips and nodes get summarized separately now]

# MEDIUM: tasks in the categories "basic functionality"
=======================================================
* make sure the data structures are reasonably complete
* Replacement methods:
   (in root.edge<- style, perhaps also setRoot style)
* order: All phylo4 edge matrices are internally stored as "cladewise"/Newick traversal order.  Extend edges accessor method with optional argument that allows edges to be extracted in a different order (possibly with an attribute as in ape); need to steal 'reorder' from ape
* Root node data characteristics (compare what OUCH does):
    root node doesn't have corresponding entry in the edge matrix: ouch adds a row to the edge matrix (1-row data frame matching node column info)
    Not entirely clear how we should deal with this, MB has a proposal.
* Rewrite methods in native phylo4 as necessary/desirable
* Plot method for phylo4d: what would be a good default?
* Figure out best way to deal with namespace/conflicts (overriding ape methods)
* graphical identify.node
* Implement "data class" by wrapping data.frame and writing an [ accessor method; reconsider this general topic -- is there 
* tree walking/generic manipulation methods
* compare: Mesquite, ape (check O'Meara list)
* change name to phylobase
* test the new plot functions 

## I/O
------

## Multiphylo Issues
--------------------
* extend classes: should we have both multiPhylo4 (no data) and multiPhylo4d (with data) 
* Implement multiphylo tree names?
* check multiPhylo! "unpack"/"pack" methods
* ctree method

# LOW PRIORITY
==============
* TreeLib wrapper?
* more tree manipulation methods
* lapply/multiple-tree methods, or at least documentation on how to do it
* compare Sidlauskas wiki documentation, how would one do it in phylo4?
* phylo4 constructor should have its own method manpage (currently is inside the class doc)

FIXED (we think)
