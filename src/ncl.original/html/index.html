<h2><a name="introduction">What is the NCL?</a></h2>

<p><b>Note: This documentation was written for version 2.0</b>.
We have tried to maintain the API described here, but new APIs are poorly documented.
See the ChangeLog and the example programs (in particular the "normalizer" example)
for examples of the usage of the new APIs.
</p>
<p>The NEXUS Class Library (NCL) is an integrated collection of C++ classes designed 
  to allow the user to quickly write a program that reads NEXUS-formatted data 
  files. It also allows easy extension of the NEXUS format to include new blocks 
  of your own design.</p>
<p>A word about the intended audience is in order before we get too far along 
  (no need to waste your time if the NCL will not be helpful to you). The intended 
  audience for both this documentation and the accompanying class library comprises 
  computer programmers who wish to endow their C++ programs with the ability to 
  read NEXUS data files. If you are not a programmer and simply use NEXUS files 
  as a means of inputting data to the programs you use for analyzing your data, 
  the NCL is not something that will be useful to you. The NCL is also not for 
  you if you are a programmer but do not use the C++ language, since the NCL depends 
  heavily on the object oriented programming features built into C++. There is 
  no Java version of the NCL, nor is one planned. This is simply a reflection 
  of the fact that I primarily program in C++ and only have time to write the 
  library once.</p>
<p>The NEXUS data file format was specified in the publication cited below. Please 
  read this paper for further information about the format specification itself; 
  the documentation for the NCL does not attempt to explain the structure of a 
  NEXUS data file.</p>
<p>Maddison, D. R., D. L. Swofford, and Wayne P. Maddison. 1997. NEXUS: an extensible 
  file format for systematic information. <i>Systematic Biology</i> 46(4): 590-621.</p>
<p>The basic goal of the NCL is to provide a relatively easy way to endow a C++ 
  program with the ability to read NEXUS data files. The steps necessary to use 
  the NCL to create a bare-bones program that can read a NEXUS data file are simple 
  and few (see the section entitled <a href="#reader">Building a NEXUS File Reader</a> 
  below), and it is hoped that the availability of this class library will encourage 
  the use of the NEXUS format. This will in turn encourage consistency in how 
  programs read NEXUS files and how programs respond to errors in data files.</p>
<p>There are a large number of special data file formats in use. This places an 
  extra burden on the end user, who must deal with an increasing number of file 
  formats all differing in a number of ways. To convert one's data file to another 
  file format often involves manual manipulation of the data, an activity that 
  is inherently dangerous and probably has resulted in the corruption of many 
  data files. At the very least, the large number of formats in existance has 
  led to a proliferation of data file variants. With many copies of a given data 
  file on a hard disk, each formatted differently for various analysis programs, 
  it becomes very easy to change one (say, correct a datum found to be in error) 
  and then fail to correct the other versions. The NEXUS file format provides 
  a means for keeping one master copy of the data and using it with several programs 
  without modification. The NCL provides a means for encouraging programmers to 
  use the NEXUS file format in future programs they write.</p>

<h2><a name="download">Obtaining the NCL?</a></h2>

<p>The current version of the NCL is available in the following formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/ncl/ncl-2.0.tar.gz">ncl-2.0.tar.gz</a> (gzipped tar archive)<br /></li>
  <li><a href="http://hydrodictyon.eeb.uconn.edu/ncl/ncl-2.0.zip">ncl-2.0.zip</a> (zip archive)</li>
</ul>
The zip file contains everything in the tar file as well as project files for 
the Microsoft Visual C++ 6 IDE. Other archive formats will be added as they become
available.

<h2><a name="characterisitics">Characteristics of the NCL</a></h2>

<h3><a name="portability">Portability</a></h3>

<p>The NCL has been designed to be as portable as possible for a C++ class library. 
  The NCL <i>does</i> make use of the ANSI Standard C++ Library (STL), but use 
  of the STL is now common and should not cause problems for modern compilers/platforms.</p>

<h3><a name="crossplatform">Cross-platform features</a></h3>

<p>I have attempted to create the NCL in such a way that one is not limited in 
  the type of platform targeted. For example, NEXUS files can contain "output 
  comments" that are supposed to be displayed in the output of the program reading 
  the NEXUS file. Such comments are handled automatically by the NCL, and are 
  sent to a virtual function that can be overridden by you in a derived class. 
  This provides a means for you to tailor the output of such comments to the platform 
  of your choice. For example, if you are writing a standard Linux console application 
  (i.e., not a graphical X-Windows application), you might want such output comments 
  to simply be sent to standard output or to an ofstream object. For a graphical 
  Windows, MacIntosh or X-Windows application, you might deem it more user-friendly 
  to pop up a message box with the output comment as the message. This would ensure 
  that the user noticed the output comment. You also have the option of having 
  your program completely ignore such comments in the data file.</p>
<p>The NCL provides similar hooks for noting the progress in reading the data 
  file. For example, the virtual function  <a href="NxsReader.html#EnteringBlock204">EnteringBlock</a>  is called and 
  provided with the name of the block about to be read. You can override  <a href="NxsReader.html#EnteringBlock204">EnteringBlock</a>  
  in your derived class to allow, for example, a message to be displayed in a 
  status bar at the bottom of your program's main window (in a graphical application) 
  indicating which block is currently being read. Other such virtual functions 
  include  <a href="NxsReader.html#SkippingBlock472">SkippingBlock</a>  (to allow users to be warned that your program 
  is ignoring a block in the data file),  <a href="NxsBlock.html#SkippingCommand171">SkippingCommand</a>  (to allow users 
  to be warned about particular commands being skipped within a block), and  <a href="NxsReader.html#NexusError444">NexusError</a> , 
  which is the function called whenever anything unexpected happens when reading 
  the file.</p>

<h3><a name="extensibility">Extensibility</a></h3>

<p>The basic tools provided in the NCL allow you to create your own NEXUS blocks 
and use them in your program. This makes it easy to define a private block to 
contain commands that only your program recognizes, allowing your users to run 
your program in batch mode (see the section below entitled <a href="#advice"> 
General Advice</a> for more information on this topic).</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

<h2><a name="limitations">Current limitations</a></h2>

<p>The main current limitation is that the NCL is incomplete. Some standard NEXUS 
  blocks have been provided with this distribution, but because the NEXUS format 
  is so extensive, even some of the standard blocks described in the paper cited 
  above have not been implemented (or have been only incompletely implemented). 
  Here is a summary table showing what has been implemented thus far:</p>
<table width=600>
  <tr> 
    <th align="left" valign="bottom">Block<br>
      <hr> 
    <th align="left" valign="bottom">Current Limitations<br>
      <hr> 
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">ASSUMPTIONS 
    <td valign="top">Only TAXSETS, CHARSETS, and EXSETS have been implemented 
      thus far. 
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">ALLELES 
    <td valign="top">Cannot yet handle transposed MATRIX, and only DATAPOINT=STANDARD 
      is implemented.
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">CHARACTERS 
    <td valign="top">Only ITEMS=STATES and STATESFORMAT=STATESPRESENT has been 
      implemented thus far, and DATATYPE=CONTINUOUS has not been implemented. 
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">DISTANCES 
    <td valign="top">No limitations, completely implemented 
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">DATA 
    <td valign="top">Since the DATA block is essentially the same as a CHARACTERS 
      block, the same limitations apply. 
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">TAXA 
    <td valign="top">No limitations, completely implemented 
  <tr> 
    <td valign="top">TREES 
    <td valign="top">No limitations, completely implemented 
</table>
<p>While the limitations for the CHARACTERS block may seem a bit extreme, this 
  block is nevertheless implemented to the point where almost all existing morphological 
  and molecular data sets can be read.</p>
<p>The ALLELES block has not yet been used in any program to my knowledge. It 
  is very similar to the GDADATA block used in my program GDA, but differs in 
  requiring NEWPOPS to be specified if a TAXA block does not precede the ALLELES 
  block (this is to make the ALLELES block more like the CHARACTERS block.</p>
<p>Some recent modifications of the NEXUS format implemented in <a href="http://mesquiteproject.org/mesquite/mesquite.html">Mesquite</a> 
  (e.g. LINK statements in the CHARACTERS block) and <a href="http://morphbank.ebc.uu.se/mrbayes/">MrBayes</a> 
  (e.g. DATATYPE=MIXED in the DATA block) are not supported in the NCL at this 
  time.</p>
<p>The NCL has been designed to be portable, easy-to-use, and informative in the 
  error messages produced. It will be apparent to anyone who looks very closely 
  at the code that some efficiency (both in executable size and speed) has been 
  sacrificed to meet these goals.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

<h2><a name="reader">Building a NEXUS File Reader</a></h2>

<p>This section illustrates how you could build a simple NEXUS file reader application 
  capable of reading in a TAXA and a TREES block. Note that the file <span class="filename">nclsimplest.cpp</span> 
  contains all of the code for this example. To keep things simple, we will just 
  write output to an ofstream object (nothing graphical here).</p>
<p>As you work through this example, feel free to look into the NCL classes in 
  more detail. A <a href="classes.html">class index</a> as well as a <a href="functions.html">member 
  function index</a> is provided at the <a href="#top">top of this document</a> 
  for quick access.</p>

<h3><a name="readermain">The Main Function</a></h3>
<pre>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
	taxa = new NxsTaxaBlock();
	trees = new NxsTreesBlock(taxa);

	MyReader nexus(argv[1], argv[2]);
	nexus.Add(taxa);
	nexus.Add(trees);

	MyToken token(nexus.inf, nexus.outf);
	nexus.Execute(token);

	taxa->Report(nexus.outf);
	trees->Report(nexus.outf);

	return 0;
	}
</pre>
<h4>Creating block objects</h4>
<p>The first two lines of the main function involve the creation of objects corresponding 
  to the two types of NEXUS blocks we want our program to recognize. NxsTaxaBlock 
  is declared in the header file <span class="filename">nxstaxablock.h</span> 
  and defined in the source code file <span class="filename">nxstaxablock.cpp</span>, 
  whereas the NxsTreesBlock class is declared in <span class="filename">nxstreesblock.h</span> 
  and defined in <span class="filename">nxstreesblock.cpp</span>. Note that the 
  NxsTreesBlock constructor requires a reference to an object of type NxsTaxaBlock. 
  This is because the taxa labels in a TREES block should correspond to any taxa 
  previously defined in a TAXA block. If no TAXA block precedes the TREES block, 
  taxon labels defined in the TREES block will be used to populate the TAXA block. 
  In the NCL, any block that defines taxon labels stores this information in the 
  NxsTaxaBlock object, and any block that needs such information requires a reference 
  to the NxsTaxaBlock object in its constructor.</p>
<h4>Adding the block objects to the NxsReader object</h4>
<p>The next three lines involve creating a NxsReader object and adding our two 
  block objects to a linked list maintained by the NxsReader object. The MyNexusReader 
  class is derived from the NxsReader class, which is declared in <span class="filename">nxsreader.h</span> 
  and defined in <span class="filename">nxsreader.cpp</span>. Although a NxsReader 
  object can be created and used, you will probably wish to derive a class from 
  it (as I did in this example) and override some of the NxsReader virtual functions, 
  such as  <a href="NxsReader.html#EnteringBlock204">EnteringBlock</a> ,  <a href="NxsReader.html#SkippingBlock472">SkippingBlock</a> , and  <a href="NxsReader.html#NexusError444">NexusError</a>  
  (the NxsReader version of these functions does nothing, and it is important 
  to at least report errors in some way to your program's users).</p>
<p>The reason the NxsReader object must maintain a list of block ojects is so 
  that it can figure out which one is responsible for reading each block found 
  in the data file. The block objects <span class="variablename">taxa</span> and 
  <span class="variablename">trees</span> have each inherited an <span class="variablename">id</span> 
  variable of type <span class="variablename">char *</span> that stores their 
  block name (i.e., "TAXA" for the TaxaBlock and "TREES" for the TreesBlock). 
  When the  <a href="NxsReader.html#Execute237">Execute</a>  member function encounters a block name, it searches 
  its linked list of block objects until it finds one whose <span class="variablename">id</span> 
  variable is identical to the name of the block encountered. It then calls the 
   <a href="NxsBlock.html#Read129">Read</a>  function of that block object to do the work of reading the block 
  from the data file and storing its contents. It is possible of course that a 
  block name will appear in a data file for which there is no corresponding block 
  object. In this case, the  <a href="NxsReader.html#Execute237">Execute</a>  method calls the  <a href="NxsReader.html#SkippingBlock472">SkippingBlock</a>  
  method to report the fact that it is skipping over the contents of the unknown 
  block.</p>
<h4>Reading the data file</h4>
<p>The next two lines create a token object (MyToken is derived from the NxsToken 
  class), and initiate the reading of the NEXUS data file using the  <a href="NxsReader.html#Execute237">Execute</a>  
  function. The input and output files are created within the MyNexusReader class. 
  While this is not required, it facilitates handling messages generated while 
  the data file is being read. The NxsToken class has one virtual member function 
  ( <a href="NxsToken.html#OutputComment133">OutputComment</a> ) which enables you to control how output comments are 
  displayed. The NxsToken version of  <a href="NxsToken.html#OutputComment133">OutputComment</a>  does nothing, so 
  you must derive your own token class from NxsToken and override the  <a href="NxsToken.html#OutputComment133">OutputComment</a>  
  method in order for the output comments in the data file to be displayed. The 
  main function of the NxsToken class is to provide a means for grabbing separate 
  NEXUS tokens (words separated by blank spaces or punctuation) one by one from 
  the data file. Calling the  <a href="NxsToken.html#GetNextToken426">GetNextToken</a>  function reads and stores 
  the next token found in the data file, correctly handling any comments found 
  along the way. This automatic comment handling greatly simplifies reading a 
  NEXUS data file.</p>
<h4>Reporting on block objects' contents</h4>
<p>The last two lines call the  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Report149">Report</a>  functions of each of the blocks. 
  This just spits out a summary of any data contained in these objects that has 
  been read from the data file.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Table of Contents</a></p>

<h3><a name="readernexus">Deriving From the Nexus Class</a></h3>

<p>Note that the <span class="variablename">ifstream</span> is opened in binary 
  mode. You should always open your input file in binary mode so that the file 
  can be read properly regardless of the platform on which it was created. For 
  example, suppose someone created a NEXUS data file on a MacIntosh and wanted 
  to read it with your program, which is running on a Windows XP machine. Opening 
  the file in binary mode allows the NxsToken object you are using to recognize 
  the newline character in the Mac file as such, even though MacIntosh computers 
  use a different symbol (ASCII 13) to represent the newline character than computers 
  running Windows (which use the ASCII 13, ASCII 10 combination for newlines).</p>

<h3><a name="readerdata">A Sample Data File</a></h3>

<p>Here is a sample data file that exercises a lot of the features of the NEXUS 
  file reader we have just created. First, there are both output and regular comments 
  scattered around. Some are between tokens, some occur at the beginning of a 
  token, and still others begin right after a token. Some comments even have nested 
  within them words surrounded by square brackets. There are also blocks in this 
  data file (i.e., the paup block) that are not recognized by the NEXUS file reader 
  we have created. The NEXUS reader handles all of these situations with very 
  minimal effort on your part. Note that you can remove the TAXA block without 
  ill effects because the taxon labels are specified in the TREES block.</p>

<h2><a name="rollown">Creating Your Own NEXUS Block</a></h2>

<p>Creating your own NEXUS block involves deriving a class from the NxsBlock base 
  class and overriding the three virtual functions  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Read129">Read</a> ,  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Reset142">Reset</a> , 
  and  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Report149">Report</a> . Use the files <span class="filename">emptyblock.cpp</span> 
  and <span class="filename">emptyblock.h</span> as templates for your own source 
  code and header files. While creating your own block class is not a complicated 
  endeavor, here are some things to watch out for:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Be sure to write the  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Reset142">Reset</a>  function in such a way that all heap 
    memory is cleaned up (deleted). This means whenever you use the <span class="variablename">new</span> 
    keyword to allocate memory for an object that will potentially persist until 
    the  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Reset142">Reset</a>  method is called, you need to put code in the  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Reset142">Reset</a>  
    function to delete it. Also, it is important to delete such objects in the 
    destructor for the class as well.<br /></li>
  <li> When writing the  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Read129">Read</a>  function, put <span class="variablename">assert</span> 
    macros everywhere you make an assumption, however insignificant this assumption 
    seems at the time of writing. This tremendously speeds up the task of finding 
    bugs when one of your assumptions turns out to not always be true!<br /></li>
  <li> When writing the  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Read129">Read</a>  function, put in a lot of tests of the 
    form: 
    <pre>
if (!token.Equals(";"))
	{
	errormsg.PrintF("Expecting ';' after TREES block name, but found %s instead.", token.GetTokenAsCStr());
	throw NxsException(errormsg, token.GetFilePosition(), token.GetFileLine(), token.GetFileColumn());
	}
</pre>
    Such checks will give your users some hope of finding where they have made 
    a mistake in constructing their data file. We all know how frustrating it 
    can be to have a program exit with an uninformative error message.</li>

<h2><a name="advice">General Advice</a></h2>

<p>A typical program making use of this library might have the following two general 
  characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li> The program is structured so that it can be compiled either as a command-line 
    driven, console program or as a graphical application (with a Windows, MacIntosh, 
    or XWindows Graphical User Interface, or GUI)<br /></li>
  <li> Handles a private NEXUS block that contains commands identical to those 
    that can be entered on the command line, enabling the program to be run in 
    batch mode</li>
</ul>
<p>After developing several programs like this, I have come up with the following 
  strategy that makes efficient use of the object-oriented nature of the NCL. 
  I will assume your non-graphical program will be called simply "Phylome" and 
  will read a private NEXUS block named "PHYLOME". I will further assume that 
  the GUI version will be targeted for the Windows platform, and will be colled 
  "PhylomeWin".</p>
<ul>
  <li> Create a class (call it PhylomeBase) that performs all the (non-graphical) 
    core functionality of the program. Be careful not to place any GUI code in 
    this class. This class should be derived (publicly) from <span class="makeconspicuous">both</span> 
    the NxsBlock class (this class will encapsulate your program's private NEXUS 
    block) and the NxsReader class (which encapsulates your program's NEXUS file 
    reading capability).<br />
  </li>
  <li> In class PhylomeBase, override the NxsBlock virtual functions  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Read129">Read</a> , 
     <a href="NxsBlock.html#Reset142">Reset</a>  and  <a href="NxsBlock.html#Report149">Report</a>  and any other handler functions needed 
    to process the commands in the private block.<br />
  </li>
  <li> In the PhylomeBase constructor, create all the NxsBlock-derived objects 
    needed (i.e., a NxsCharactersBlock object, a NxsTaxaBlock object, etc.) and 
    add these to PhylomeBase using the  <a href="NxsReader.html#Add44">Add</a>  function. Don't forget to 
    Add(this) too so that your program can read the private block. Note that "this" 
    is both a NxsReader object as well as a NxsBlock object, so it is able to 
    add itself to the list of blocks processed upon execution of a NEXUS data 
    file.<br />
  </li>
  <li> Now create a class PhylomeWin that handles the Windows GUI interface, deriving 
    publicly from PhylomeBase. In class PhylomeWin, override the NxsReader virtual 
    functions  <a href="NxsReader.html#EnteringBlock204">EnteringBlock</a> ,  <a href="NxsReader.html#SkippingBlock472">SkippingBlock</a> , and  <a href="NxsReader.html#NexusError444">NexusError</a> . 
    For instance, within  <a href="NxsReader.html#NexusError444">NexusError</a> , you might put up a MessageBox 
    telling the user about an error encountered in the data file.<br />
  </li>
  <li> For the command-driven version, create a class Phylome that is derived 
    from PhylomeBase, overrides the NxsReader and NxsBlock virtual functions (like 
    its GUI counterpart, PhylomeWin), and provides a means for users to enter 
    commands (you should create a mechanism in PhylomeBase so that you can use 
    the same machinery to process commands typed in from the keyboard as you use 
    to process commands contained in a private block). The <span class="filename">basiccmdline.h</span> 
    and <span class="filename">basiccmdline.cpp</span> files are provided as an 
    example of how to create a basic console program with an interactive command 
    line interface.</li>

<h2><a name="whatyoucando">What You Can Do For Me</a></h2>

<p>I hope this library is useful to you, and note that it is free software under 
  the <a href="COPYING">Gnu General Public License.</a></p>
<p>Although you are not obligated in any way to me as a result of using this library 
  to create programs, there are a few things that you can do to help encourage 
  me to continue improving this library. Please make use of any of the following 
  means of support that you feel comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Cite the NCL! If you publish an announcement of a program of yours that 
    includes the NCL, please acknowledge that your program includes the NCL.<br /></li>
	
  <li> Advertise the NCL! If your program produces output either on the screen 
    or in the form of a file, mention that your program uses the NCL in your program's 
    output.<br /></li>
	
  <li> Help me fix bugs. If you discover a bug, please let me know about it so that I can
    get it fixed. Scroll up to the section entitled &quot;Reporting Bugs&quot; for the (simple)
    instructions for reporting a bug.</li>
	
  <li> Give me suggestions. I welcome suggestions for improving the library and 
    making it more convenient to use. I can't guarantee that I will have time 
    to honor all requests, but I will try my best.</li> 
</ul>

<h2><a name="future">Future Of The NCL Project</a></h2>

<p>The current capabilities of the NCL are best illustrated by taking a look at 
  some of the data files that it can successfully read. For example, the NCL can 
  successfully read data files available on the <a href="http://ucjeps.herb.berkeley.edu/bryolab/greenplantpage.html">"Green 
  Plant Phylogeny Research Coordination Group"</a> website, which have a reasonably 
  compicated structure.Included with the NCL are data files containing multiple 
  DISTANCES blocks (<span class="filename">distances.nex</span>) or multiple CHARACTERS 
  blocks (<span class="filename">characters.nex</span>) to illustrate some of 
  the formatting options available with these two NEXUS block types. These examples 
  amply demonstrate the capabilities of the NCL as it now stands, however the 
  NCL will continue to grow as code for recognizing more and more NEXUS blocks 
  are added. I welcome both suggestions for improvement as well as bug reports, 
  of course.</p>
