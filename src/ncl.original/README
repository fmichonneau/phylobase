NCL README -- the NEXUS Class Library (NCL) README file

Most documentation for this C++ class library is in the form of HTML 
files in the html directory. Please begin by viewing the html/index.html
file in your web browser.

See the INSTALL file for important information about building and installing
the NCL and example programs, and incorporating the NCL into your own
applications.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
	Many of the files used for testing were provided by Arlin Stoltzfus (see
http://www.molevol.org/camel/projects/nexus/ for more information), the Mesquite
package, and from TreeBase (thanks, to Bill Piel!).

	The SWIG bindings for version 2.1 were inspired by the work of David Suarez 
Pascal in the 2007 Google Summer of Code.  They were simplified using new 
features of NCL 2.1.  Thanks to David for blazing the way on the old version,
Google for funding, and NESCent (in particular Hilmar Lapp) for getting the
NESCent GSoC program going.
