/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	This is a template that can be used to create a class representing a NEXUS block. Here are the steps to follow if
|	you wish to create a new block specifically for use with your particular application. Suppose your application is
|	called Phylome and you want to create a private block called a PHYLOME block that can appear in NEXUS data files
|	and contains commands for your program.
|~
|	o Copy the files nxsemptyblock.h and nxsemptyblock.cpp and rename them (e.g. nxsphylomeblock.h and 
|	  nxsphylomeblock.cpp)
|	o In nxsphylomeblock.h and nxsphylomeblock.cpp, replace all instances of EMPTY (case-sensitive, whole word search)
|	  with PHYLOME
|	o In nxsphylomeblock.h, replace both instances of NCL_NXSEMPTYBLOCK_H at the top of the file with
|	  NCL_NXSPHYLOMEBLOCK_H
|	o In nxsphylomeblock.h and nxsphylomeblock.cpp, replace all instances of NxsEmptyBlock (case-sensitive, whole word
|	  search) with NxsPhylomeBlock
|	o Modify the Read function in nxsphylomeblock.cpp to interpret what comes after the BEGIN PHYLOME command in the
|	  NEXUS data file
|	o Modify the CharLabelToNumber and TaxonLabelToNumber if you need to read in sets of characters or taxa, 
|	  respectively. These functions provide a way for NxsSetReader objects to translate character or taxon labels to
|	  the corresponding numbers. If you do not need these capabilities, then it is safe to just delete these functions
|	  from nxsphylomeblock.h and nxsphylomeblock.cpp because they are no different that the base class versions
|	o Modify the SkippingCommand function if you want to notify users when commands within the PHYLOME block are not 
|	  recognized and are being skipped
|	o In nxsphylomeblock.h, replace this comment with something meaningful for your class. Start off with something
|	  like "This class handles reading and storage for the NEXUS block PHYLOME. It overrides the member functions 
|	  Read and Reset, which are abstract virtual functions in the base class NxsBlock"
|~
|	Adding a new data member? Don't forget to:
|~
|	o Describe it in the class declaration using a C-style comment. 
|	o Initialize it (unless it is self-initializing) in the constructor and reinitialize it in the Reset function.
|	o Describe the initial state in the constructor documentation. 
|	o Delete memory allocated to it in both the destructor and Reset function. 
|	o Report it in some way in the Report function. 
|~
