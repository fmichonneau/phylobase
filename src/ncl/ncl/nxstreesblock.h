/*----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|	This class handles reading and storage for the NEXUS block TREES. It overrides the member functions Read and Reset,
|	which are abstract virtual functions in the base class NxsBlock. The translation table (if one is supplied) is 
|	stored in the `translateList'. The tree names are stored in `treeName' and the tree descriptions in 
|	`treeDescription'. Information about rooting of trees is stored in `rooted'. Note that no checking is done to 
|	ensure that the tree descriptions are valid. The validity of the tree descriptions could be checked after the TREES
|	block has been read (but before the next block in the file has been read) by overriding the NxsReader::ExitingBlock
|	member function, but no functionality for this is provided by the NCL. Below is a table showing the correspondence
|	between the elements of a TREES block and the variables and member functions that can be used to access each piece 
|	of information stored.
