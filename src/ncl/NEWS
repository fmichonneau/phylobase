Please send NCL bug reports to paul.lewis@uconn.edu.

See ChangeLog for details about minor upgrades.

Version 2.0
-----------
Although this is the second version of the library, it is really the
first official release. My container classes used in the first version
have been replaced by their STL equivalents, and the source code 
documentation is now much more thorough. This version is being pubicized
in the form of an application note in the journal Bioinformatics.

Version 1.0
-----------
This first version did not make use of the standard template library,
instead using container classes of my own design. This version was 
distributed from my web site, but never publicized.
