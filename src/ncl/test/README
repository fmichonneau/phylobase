The files in the NTS*In directories were provided by Arlin Stoltzfus. see
	http://www.molevol.org/camel/projects/nexus/ for more information.

The files in NTSValidIn should be accepted by NCL.

The files in NTSInvalidIn should generate errors.

The corresponding output files are found in the NTS*Out dir and have the same
	file name as the input.  These output files will be sensitive to
	inconsequential changes in formatting in the normalizer program, but will
	still be useful for regression testing.
