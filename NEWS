                CHANGES IN phylobase VERSION 0.6
                
MAJOR CHANGES

    *   Updated to the Nexus Class Library (NCL) 2.1.12.
    
    *   Changed the way NCL is built during the installation process.
    
    *   Complete rewrite of the function readNexus which brings many new
        functionalities.
        
    *   Nodes labels do not have to be unique.
    
        
NEW FEATURES
   
    *   In readNexus, the option return.labels gives the state labels of the
        characters.
        
    *   It is now possible to import several types of  data blocks in a single
        NEXUS file with readNexus.
        
    *   The function phylobase.options() provides global options to control the
        behavior of the phylo4/phylo4d validator.
        
    *   The new method hasDuplicatedLabels() indicates whether any node labels
        are duplicated.
        
    *   The new method nData() returns the number of datasets associated with
        a tree.
        
    *   The column that contains the labels can now be specified by its name in
        the function formatData()
     
CHANGES

    *   The function getNode() has been modified to allow node matching in the
        case of non-unique labels.
        
    *   Many new unit tests.
    
BUG FIXES

    *   Far too many to document.  See the SVN log for details.

KNOWN ISSUES

    *   Unrooted trees are not supported by all functions, e.g. plot() and 
        reorder().

    *   Factors are not supported by the default plotting method.

                CHANGES IN phylobase VERSION 0.5

MAJOR CHANGES

    *   A var-cov matrix tree class, phylo4vcov, and methods for converting to 
        and from other classes now exists.

    *   Replaced separate the tip.label and node.label slots with a unified 
        label slot in the phylo4 class definition.

    *   Replaced separate the tip.data and node.data into a single data slot in 
        the phylo4d class definition.

    *   The phylo4 class grew a annotate slot.

    *   The phylo4d class grew a metadata slot.

    *   Added an order slot to the phylo4 class definition and updated as()
        methods to assign the proper order (if possible) when converting 
        between ape and phylobase tree formats.

    *   The Nnode slot was removed from the phylo4 class definition.

    *   An explicit root edge has been added to the edge matrix with 0 as the 
        ancestor and nTips(phy) + 1 as the rood node.

    *   The edgeLabels() and edgeLength() accessors now return vectors with 
        named elements in the same order as rows of the edge matrix, even when 
        some/all values are missing.

    *   The labels() accessor and nodeID() methods now always return labels in 
        ascending order of node ID

    *   Many function and argument names and defaults have been changed to make 
        them more consistent most functions follow the getNode() pattern.

    *   The plotting functions have been replaced (see below).

    *   Now, data are matched against node numbers instead of node labels.

    *   Tip and internal node labels have now internal names that are character 
        strings of the node number they correspond to. Thus it is possible to 
        store labels in any order and assignment of labels more robust.

    *   We now use the RUnit package (not required for normal use) for adding 
        unit tests.  Adding unit tests to inst/unitTests/ is now preferred over 
        the tests/ directory.

    *   Numerous changes to pruning and tree subsetting code.  It is 
        considerably more robust and no longer relies on calls to APE.

NEW FEATURES

    *   Added a function nodeType() for identifying whether a node is root, 
        tip or internal.

    *   Changed nodeNumbers to nodeId() and extended it abilities.

    *   Added method reorder() for converting edge matrices into preorder or 
        postorder.

    *   Added the edgeOrder accessor to get the order of a phylobase object.

    *   Added a package help file accessible from ?phylobase.

    *   Added labels()<- for assigning labels.

    *   Added edgeLength()<- for assigning edgeLengths.

    *   Added a phylo4() method for importing APE phylo objects.

    *   Added a hasTipData() method.

    *   Added a edgeId() method.

    *   Created the addData() method for adding data to phylo4 objects.

    *   Added tipData and nodeData getter/setter methods

    *   If all node.labels are numerical values, they are automatically 
        converted as data. Useful when importing consensus tree from MrBayes.

    *   It is now possible to print tree objects in edge order using the 
        edgeOrder argument in printphylo4().

    *   reorder(), descendants(), ancestors(), and portions of the plotting code 
        have been recoded in C to improve performance.

    *   Added a developer vignette to document and guide development of the 
        phylobase package.

    *   The previous plotting functions, based on base graphics, have been 
        replaced with function based on the grid graphics device.

    *   A S4 generic plot() function, calling treePlot() has been added it 
        dispatches a plotting function based on object class and arguments.

    *   Plots using grid based code can be inserted at the tree tips using the 
        tip.plot.fun argument in plot()

    *   The getNode() method has been enhanced to allow matching against 
        specific node types, and if the requested node is missing, all nodes of 
        specified type are returned.

    *   Changed getEdge() to allow no node argument, which returns all edges 
        appropriate for the given type.

CHANGES

    *   Node labels are, if not supplied, a vector of NA.

    *   printphylo() is now deprecated, print() and summary() now alsow work on 
        empty objects.

    *   phylo4() is now and S4 generic with signature "matrix".

    *   phylobase now uses a NAMESPACE file.

    *   Legacy plotting code (0.4) can be found in the SVN repo tags directory.

    *   The tdata default "type" argument changed to 'all'.

    *   Row names now stored internally as numeric, not character. 

BUG FIXES

    *   Far too many to document.  See the SVN log for details.

KNOWN ISSUES

    *   Unrooted trees are not supported by all functions, e.g. plot() and 
        reorder().

    *   Factors are not supported by the default plotting method.

    *   The Nexus Class Library is build for the system default ARCH which may 
        or may not be the architecture that R and the rest of the package is 
        built with.  If this occurs the package will fail to load.

    *   Unique labels are required for internal nodes, this behavior will be 
        changed in the future.
